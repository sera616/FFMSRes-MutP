# FFMSRes-MutP


# Model
The ".h5" file of FFMSRes-MutP is larger than 25Mb, so it is not allowed to upload. 
code/FFMSRes-MutP.py  and code/MSRes-MutP.py are the proposed two deep learning models.


# Code
## feature_genetate.py / feature_genetate2.py
This program is utilized to run PSIBLAST, PSIPRED, SANN, and DISOPRED.
Before using this codes, users should install the above four tools on their own computer.

## feature_extract.py / feature_extract2.py
After PSIBLAST, PSIPRED, SANN, and DISOPRED finished, use feature_extract.py to get local characteristics for each mutation in the dataset.

## main.py / main2.py
Prepare feature file and make the final prediction.
